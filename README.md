# scufl2-info

Returns Linked Data information about a SCUFL2 URI

The idea is that say

    http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/workflow/HelloWorld/processor/Hello/out/fred"

will redirect to this service to "guess" the partial workflow structure
expressed in the URI - e.g. that we're talking about an output port 
`fred` in processor `Hello` in workflow `HelloWorld` in workflow bundle
with uuid `746....a19`.

## Example

    http://localhost:3000/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/workflow/HelloWorld/processor/Hello%20there/out/fred

returns almost-JSON-LD:
    {
      "workflow": {
        "processor": {
          "@id": "workflow/HelloWorld/processor/Hello%20there/",
          "@type": "Processor",
          "name": "Hello there"
        },
        "@id": "workflow/HelloWorld/",
        "@type": "Workflow",
        "name": "HelloWorld"
      },
      "@context": {
        "@base": "http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/",
        "@vocab": "http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/scufl2#"
      },
      "@id": "http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/",
      "@type": "WorkflowBundle"
    }


## TODO

- datalinks, control links, activities, profiles, configurations, dispatch layer
- Other RDF formats: RDF/XML and Turtle
- Search myExperiment by UUID to add @seeAlso
- wfdesc
- pretty-print of JSON
- Avoid \/ escaping in JSON
