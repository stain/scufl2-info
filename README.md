# scufl2-info

Returns Linked Data information about a SCUFL2 URI

The idea is that say

	http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/workflow/HelloWorld/processor/Hello/out/fred"

will redirect to this service to "guess" the partial workflow structure
expressed in the URI - e.g. that we're talking about an output port 
"fred" in processor "Hello" in workflow "HelloWorld" in workflow bundle
"746....a19".

Currently returns almost-JSON-LD:

	http://localhost:3000/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/workflow/HelloWorld/processor/Hello/out/fred

	{"workflow":{"processor":{"outputProcessorPort":{"@id":"http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/workflow/HelloWorld/processor/Hello/out/fred","@type":"OutputProcesorPort","name":"fred"},"@id":"http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/workflow/HelloWorld/processor/Hello/","@type":"Processor","name":"Hello"},"@id":"http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/workflow/HelloWorld/","@type":"Workflow","name":"HelloWorld"},"@id":"http://ns.taverna.org.uk/2010/workflowBundle/74674670-04d0-4832-9651-bfc3a2ec3a19/","@type":"WorkflowBundle"}

TODO: 
- Make and declare JSON-LD context with scufl2 mapping
- datalinks, control links, activities, profiles, configurations, dispatch layer
- Other RDF formats: RDF/XML and Turtle
- Search myExperiment by UUID to add @seeAlso
- wfdesc
- pretty-print of JSON
